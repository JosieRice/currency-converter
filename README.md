# Currency Converter

## To run

1. make a copy of `.env.example` named `.env`
2. put in an api key from [Exchange Rate API](https://app.exchangerate-api.com/)
3. `npm i`
4. `npm run dev`

## Plan

Write a small JavaScript currency conversion application using React. The user should be able to perform
the following actions:
• Select a source country currency.
• Select a destination country currency.
• Enter the amount to convert.
• Display the converted amount to 2 decimal places, along with the current exchange rate
that was used.

You can use the following APIs to complete this task, but if you are familiar with other API’s that provide
the same or similar information, please feel free to use those:
• https://restcountries.com/ to retrieve a list of countries.
• https://www.exchangerate-api.com/ to retrieve exchange rates (sign up required, just an
email address).
